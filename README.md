# Data-Scientist-Personal-Manifesto
This manifesto serves as a personal guide to help understand the process of data science, 
which covers all the CRISP-DM process from problem formulation, data acquisition, 
modeling and analysis, and presentation and integration into action. It seeks to explore what data scientists do, 
reflecting on what special knowledge and skills, perspectives, and ethical commitments data scientists have to 
bring to bear along this process. It builds upon fundamental principles that allow data scientists to tackle real world problems.
